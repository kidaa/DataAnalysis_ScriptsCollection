These files have been written during my work at Sage Bionetworks and used for
file processing and data analysis.

List of scripts:

BasicSVD.R
BatchTraitsCorrelation.R
BatchTraitsCorrelation_short.R
chisqTest_testLevels.R
combineGEOrawFiles.R
combineTCGALevel3data.R
createShortID.R
factorConcat.R
FtestPermut.R
gunzipLoop.R
Illumina450kTargetsDensity.R
kMeansEvaluation.R
MakesMethyLumiRobject_GBM.R
MakesMethyLumiRobject.R
mostVariableCpGsPerGene.R
multipleMatch.R
PCtechCorrelations.R
README
selectCpgWithMaxSD_perGene.R
selectMostVarCpGs.R
SurvivalBasicAnalysis.R
TCGAcollectMethPvalue.R

Each script is pretty well commented and explains what it does. Many of the
scripts were created to deal with TCGA DNA methylation data, such as unpacking
it, generating a single matrix from multiple Level1 files, creating short
patient IDs from aliquot IDs, correlating batch with the clinical variables
etc.
